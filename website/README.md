# FastExcel Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above (which can be checked by running `node -v`). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed.
- When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Local Development

Preview the English website locally:

```bash
pnpm start
```

Preview the Chinese website locally:

```bash
pnpm start --locale zh-cn
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Internationalization

To write Chinese translation files, run:

```bash
pnpm write-translations --locale zh-cn
```

To write English translation files, run:

```bash
pnpm write-translations --locale en
```

## Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
